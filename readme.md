# 📘 Aleo Monorepo

This repository contains a collection of Aleo programs and zero-knowledge proof experiments.  
It centralises multiple subprojects developed during my research, prototyping, and protocol design work on the Aleo network.

## 📂 Projects

### **Aleo_ARC4626_vault/**
An Aleo implementation inspired by the ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard.  
Used for experimenting with private yield-bearing vaults, deposit/withdraw flows, and future privacy-preserving DeFi primitives.

### **Proof_Of_Care/**
A zero-knowledge proof prototype demonstrating private eligibility proofs and privacy-preserving verification flows.  
Part of a broader exploration into social impact and identity applications on Aleo.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this monorepo is to provide:
- A clean, public overview of my Aleo development work  
- A central place for experiments, prototypes, and reusable building blocks  
- A foundation for future Aleo-based DeFi, identity, and ZK research projects  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Aleo / Leo**  
- **Zero-knowledge circuits**  
- **Private state transitions**  
- **CLI tools & scripts**
